    "# Report for Banana Collector solved by a DQN algorithm\n",
    "## Code implementation description\n",
    "The whole code contains four python files:\n",
    "1. `model.py` contains a class Actor, which is a neural network (NN) with two hidden layers (37,64,64,4), so this NN codifies the policy.\n",
    "1. `dqn_agent.py` has a class Agent with an Actor class and ReplayBuffer class as members, Agent has three important methods `act`, `step` and `learn`. Furthermore ReplayBuffer is an implementation of the Expirience Replay technique propose in the DQN algorithm.\n",
    "1. `dqn_monitor.py` has a function which implements the interacion of Unity environment and the class Agent following the DQN algorithm.\n",

    "The submission has concrete future ideas for improving performance"
